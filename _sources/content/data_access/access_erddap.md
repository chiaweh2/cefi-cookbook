What is ERDDAP
===
On the [GitHub page of ERDDAP](https://github.com/BobSimons/erddap), it gives a short and precise introduction to ERDDAP. 
> ERDDAP is a scientific data server that gives users a simple, consistent way to download subsets of gridded and tabular scientific datasets in common file formats and make graphs and maps. ERDDAP is a Free and Open Source (Apache and Apache-like) Java Servlet from NOAA NMFS SWFSC Environmental Research Division (ERD).

In practice, ERDDAP is being used by many institutes and agencies (including NOAA) to help distribute and visualize the data. 
Despite of having the easy to use concept in mind, it is sometime not a trivial/intuitive task to use the platform for many researchers and for the general public. 
The following notebooks and pages are aiming to provide some introduction to the basic and advance usage for people that are not familir with the ERDDAP server.
