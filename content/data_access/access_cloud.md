##  What is Cloud Storage for CEFI data
CEFI provides cloud storage options through the NOAA NODD program, offering data access via Google Cloud Storage and AWS S3 buckets. These cloud storage services mirror the data available on the THREDDS server at PSL, providing an alternative access point. While the datasets in the cloud should remain identical to those on the THREDDS server, there may be some lag in synchronization. Currently, the cloud storage is in the testing phase, so path structures may change. We will make every effort to keep paths updated and notify users of any modifications.
